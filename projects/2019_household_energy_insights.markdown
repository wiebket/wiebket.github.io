### Role: Project Lead, Research Data Scientist: 2017 - 2019  
The Big Data for Household Energy Insights project was housed at the Energy Research Centre at the University of Cape Town. The goals of the project were to provide strategic support and leadership to convene and mobilise key stakeholders towards building big data capabilities for domestic load research and to deliver technical data science and data stewardship activities in this regard.

The project has delivered South Africa's first online, citeable datasets of <a href="https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/NRSLR/about" target="_blank">Domestic Electrical Load</a> (DEL) studies in South Africa. The published DEL datasets capture valuable household electricity consumption and survey data that covers over two decades of research gathered under the National Rationalised Specification Load Research Programme. Hosted securely at DataFirst, Africa's only internationally accredited data archive, the datasets are now available to researchers for non-commercial use. The DEL datasets cover the period of major electrification in South Africa from 1994 to 2014 and span across five climatic zones, two time zones and various population groups. They are unique on the African continent and their release marks the pioneering step that key stakeholders - namely Eskom, a group of municipal stakeholders, the University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University, professionals and specialists working in the load research space - have taken to advance and open data-driven energy research to a broader audience through digitisation and open data. Together with the five DEL datasets that have been published, the project has released two open source python packages to facilitate data access and processing.

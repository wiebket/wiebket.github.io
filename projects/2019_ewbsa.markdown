### Role: Co-founder, Director, CEO (2013 - 2019)  
<a href="https://www.ewbsa.org" target="_blank">Engineers Without Borders South Africa</a> (EWB-SA) is a non-profit organisation that I co-founded in 2013 to empower engineers to empower communities. Since its establishment, EWB-SA has been focused on delivering programmes for youth leadership and engineering education, as well as social impact projects through our national chapter network. In 2018 EWB-SA established a unique partnership with EWB-UK and EWB-USA to collaborate on expanding the <a href="https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-work/design-challenges/engineering-for-people-design-challenge/" target="_blank">Engineering for People Design Challenge</a> to an international audience while delivering a first-of-its-kind engineering education curriculum transformation programme to South African universities.

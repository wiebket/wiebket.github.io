I am an experienced researcher who has worked in machine learning, data science, data governance, and engineering for over a decade. I have taken on many roles from programmer to project owner and collaborated with people in the non-profit, commercial, academic and public sectors, to serve the e-commerce, electricity, healthcare, biometrics and consumer technology industries. Multi-lingual, culturally sensitive and glocally (globally + locally) minded, I have successfully executed projects with collaborators and stakeholders in Europe, Africa, North America and Australia. 


I am currently completing my PhD at the Technology, Policy and Management Faculty at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, where I work under the supervision of <a href="http://homepage.tudelft.nl/8e79t/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Aaron Ding</a> and am promoted by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/full-professors/profdrir-mfwha-marijn-janssen/" target="_blank">Prof. dr. ir. Marijn Janssen</a>. My thesis focuses on design patterns for detecting and mitigating bias in Edge AI. In my research and practice I seek to understand the characteristics and limitations of AI systems by building testing frameworks to characterise trustworthiness aspects, like fairness. I view AI systems as a powerful technology that can enable large, engineered systems to be flexible, personalised and adaptive. As such, they must be trustworthy and behave reliably in complex and safety-critical applications. During my PhD I have worked as a summer research intern at Nokia Bell Labs in Cambridge, UK and at Sony AI in Zurich, Switzerland.

I hold a MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cape Town, where I studied under the supervision of 
<a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~deshen/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Deshen Moodley</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~tmeyer/prof-biography.html" target="_blank">Prof. Tommie Meyer</a>. Prior to my PhD I co-founded Engineers Without Borders South Africa, a non-profit organisation with the mission to empower engineers to empower communities. I am a fellow of the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (St Andrews, 2022), Data Science for Social Good (London, 2019) and the TechWomen programme (Silicon Valley, 2018). I am always open to conversations about AI and consciousness, large scale infrastructure development and transformation.

I am a PhD researcher in the ICT research group of the 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/engineering-systems-and-services/" target="_blank">Engineering Systems and Services</a> department in the Technology, Policy and Managament faculty at the Technical University of Delft. I work under the supervision of <a href="http://homepage.tudelft.nl/8e79t/index.html" target="_blank">dr. Aaron Ding</a> and am promoted by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/full-professors/profdrir-mfwha-marijn-janssen/" target="_blank">Prof. dr. ir. Marijn Janssen</a>. My research focuses on designing, testing and evaluating system architectures for edge intelligence to embed predictive and decision-making capabilities in complex, dynamic and unpredictable Internet-of-Things enabled environments, such as smart grids.

I received my masters in computer science with distinction from the University of Cape Town under the supervision of 
<a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~deshen/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Deshen Moodley</a> and [Prof. Tommie Meyer](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~tmeyer/prof-biography.html){:target="\_blank"}. My masters work investigated unsupervised machine learning techniques for generating representative household energy consumption patterns in South Africa, a developing country with a highly variable population. In particular, I demonstrated that nuanced and context-specific qualitative evaluation measures informed by expert insights can support the efficient, transparent and repeatable evaluation of clustering models in a real-world application.

Outside of my academic research I am the co-founder of Engineers Without Borders South Africa, a non-profit organisation with the mission to empower engineers to empower communities. I am a fellow of TechWomen (Silicon Valley, 2018) and Data Science for Social Good (London, 2019), and am frequently invited to speak on the impact of technology and digitisation on society. I am always open to conversations about technology, social impact and their influence on each other.

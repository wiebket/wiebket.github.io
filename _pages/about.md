I am a PhD researcher in the ICT research group of the 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/engineering-systems-and-services/" target="_blank">Engineering Systems and Services</a> 
department at the Technology, Policy and Managament faculty at the Technical University of Delft. I work under the supervision of <a href="http://homepage.tudelft.nl/8e79t/index.html" target="_blank">dr. Aaron Ding</a> and am promoted by 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/full-professors/profdrir-mfwha-marijn-janssen/" target="_blank">Prof. dr. ir. Marijn Janssen</a>. 
My research looks into the design of edge architectures for smart cyber-physical systems to realise large scale data processing and machine learning applications within distributed sensor networks. Our use cases focus primarily on smart grids.

I received my masters in computer science with a specialisation in applied artificial intelligence with distinction from the University of Cape Town under the supervision of 
<a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~deshen/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Deshen Moodley</a> and 
[Prof. Tommie Meyer](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~tmeyer/prof-biography.html){:target="\_blank"}. 
My masters work investigated clustering techniques for generating daily residential energy consumption patterns in a developing country context with a highly variable population. In particular, we explored how evaluation of unsupervised machine learning models can yield more useful results when traditional quantitative metrics are combined with qualitative measures derived through expert consultation.

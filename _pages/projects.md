## Big Data for Household Energy Insights

#### 2017 - 2019  
The Big Data for Household Energy Insights project was housed at the Energy Research Centre at the University of Cape Town. The goals of the project were to provide strategic support and leadership to convene and mobilise key stakeholders towards building big data capabilities for domestic load research and to deliver technical data science and data stewardship activities in this regard.

The project has delivered South Africa's first online, citeable datasets of <a href="https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/DELS" target="_blank">Domestic Electrical Load</a> (DEL) studies in South Africa. The published DEL datasets capture valuable household energy consumption and survey data that covers over two decades of research gathered under the NRS Load Research Programme. Hosted securely at DataFirst, Africa's only internationally accredited data archive, the datasets are now available to researchers for non-commercial use. The DEL datasets cover the period of major electrification in South Africa from 1994 to 2014 and span across five climatic zones, two time zones and various population groups. They are unique on the African continent and their release marks the pioneering step that key stakeholders - namely Eskom, a group of municipal stakeholders, the University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University, professionals and specialists working in the load research space - have taken to advance and open data-driven energy research to a broader audience through digitisation and open data. Together with the five DEL datasets that have been published, the project has released two open source python packages to facilitate data access and processing.

## Engineers Without Borders South Africa

<a href="https://www.ewbsa.org" target="_blank">Engineers Without Borders South Africa</a> (EWB-SA) is a non-profit organisation established in 2013 with a mission to empower engineers to empower communities. Since its establishment, EWB-SA has been focused on delivering programmes for youth leadership and engineering education, as well as social impact projects through our national chapter network. In 2018 EWB-SA established a unique partnership with EWB-UK and EWB-USA to collaborate on expanding the <a href="https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-work/design-challenges/engineering-for-people-design-challenge/" target="_blank">Engineering for People Design Challenge</a> to an international audience while delivering a first-of-its-kind engineering education curriculum transformation programme to South African universities.

## Data for Water and Sanitation Infrastructure (Data4WASI) 

#### 2019  
<img class="col one first" style="float: right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2019-06_Data4WASI_impact.png" >

Data4WASI was conceptualised to address the critical state of South Africa's water and sanitation services. Municipalities have been facing severe challenges in delivering infrastructure and associated services that meet their residents' needs. The reasons are complex and include a shortage of skilled technical professionals such as engineers and project managers, difficult work environments and poor data capturing practices. Very few municipalities collect the data necessary for effective operations, maintenance and planning of infrastructure. 

Data4WASI is a student internship programme that has been designed to assist local government with collecting and updating data required for successful management of water and sanitation infrastructure assets. The programme exposes students to the technology, complex systems, software tools and challenges that local government uses and encounters on a daily basis to deliver critical infrastructure and services to the people of South Africa. The programme was developed in collaboartion with the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency and has a direct impact on data management for Water Service Authorities in rural and distressed municipalities.

After its initial pilot, the programme has been incorporated into Engineers Without Borders South Africa as _Data for Municipal Infrastructure Assets (Data4MIA)_.

## Deep Learning for Echocardiogram Analysis
#### 2019  

The _Deep Learning for Echocardiogram Analysis_ code base was developed and open-sourced during the 2019 <a href="http://www.dssgfellowship.org/project/increasing_efficiency_heart_function_through_echocardiography/" target="_blank"> Data Science for Social Good</a> Fellowship programme. The project automates the analysis of echocardiogram images to detect normal heart functioning.

Echocardiograms are ultrasound images of the heart, that are lower in cost and quicker to perform than other imaging techniques such as MR images and CT scans. They are thus the most frequently used cardiac imaging technique for preventative screenings and ongoing monitoring of heart conditions. Cardiologists spend a significant amount of time analysing echocardiograms and reporting on the results. Many of these analytical studies are for people with normal heart functioning that require no further medical intervention. Automating the identification of normal heart function from echocardiogram images can potentially reduce the time that cardiologists spend in front of computers and help them increase the amount of time spent with ill patients that need them most.

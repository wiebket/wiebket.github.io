## Big Data for Household Energy Insights

The Big Data for Household Energy Insights project is housed at the Energy Research Centre at the University of Cape Town. The goals of the project are to provide strategic support and leadership to convene and mobilise key stakeholders towards building big data capabilities for domestic load research, and to deliver technical data science and stewardship activities in this regard. The project has delivered South Africa's first online datasets of <a href="https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/DELS" target="_blank">Domestic Electrical Load</a> (DEL) studies.

## Data for Municipal Infrastructure Assets (Data4MIA)

Data4MIA is a student internship programme that has been designed to assist local government with collecting and updating data required for successful management of water and sanitation infrastructure assets. The programme exposes students to the technology, complex systems, software tools and challenges that local government uses and encounters on a daily basis to deliver critical infrastructure and services to the people of South Africa. The programme was developed in collaboartion with the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency and has a direct impact on data management for Water Service Authorities in rural and distressed municipalities.

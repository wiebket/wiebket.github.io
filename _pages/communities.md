## Fellowships

### Data Science for Social Good  
The <a href="http://www.dssgfellowship.org/people/2019-fellows-mentors-imperial/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellowship is one of the longest standing summer programmes to train data scientists to work on real-world problems with tangible social impact. I was part of the 2019 cohort of fellows hosted by Imperial College London and worked on a project using deep learning to analyse echocardiograms.

### TechWomen 
<a href="https://www.techwomen.org/" target="_blank">TechWomen</a> 
is an initiative by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International and Cultural Affairs. The programme annually selects 5 women from 21 countries for an immersive networking and career development experience in Silicon Valley. I had the fantastic opportunity to be mentored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillfinlayson" target="_blank">Jill Finlayson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mollypyle" target="_blank">Molly Pyle</a> at <a href="https://su.org/ventures/" target="_blank">Singularity University Ventures</a> in 2018. 

### Young Africa Leadership Initiative
The <a href="https://www.africaleadership.net/about/young-africa-leadership-initiative-yali/" target="_blank">Young Africa Leadership Initiative</a> (YALI) is premised on the purpose of the <a href="https://www.africaleadership.net" target="_blank">Africa Leadership Initiative</a>. YALI's mandate is to develop the next generation of values-based young African leaders who are prepared to be significant and be co-creators of a good society. I participated in YALI in 2016-17.
